# Advent Of Code 2022

Language used : JavaScript

## Day 1

I used sort(), but I could have used a simple specific algo to remain in O(n)

## Day 2

I used `modulo` to avoid listing all the cases

## Day 3

A simple but bad idea is to use nested `for` loops. To reduce the complexity, it's better to use another data structure : `Set`

## Day 4

Very simple 

## Day 5

More data to format but it is still simple. I factor the appropriate code to solve part 1 and 2 because they are more about 95% similar 

## Day 6

## Day 7

I struggled a lot on that one because I didn't know how to visit every element of an array that has an unknown depth. I manage to do it with recursivity but I think it is a constraint to improve the complexity in this case because we can't take shortcuts to stop the exploration.
